# AI File Analysis Patterns

## OpenAI Integration Patterns

### Function Calling for File Categorization
```python
# Recommended OpenAI function structure
functions = [
    {
        "name": "analyze_files_for_deletion",
        "description": "Analyze files and provide deletion recommendations with confidence scores",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "files": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {"type": "string"},
                            "extension": {"type": "string"},
                            "size_bytes": {"type": "integer"},
                            "modified_date": {"type": "string"},
                            "directory_path": {"type": "string"},
                            "file_type": {"type": "string"}
                        }
                    }
                },
                "cleaning_objective": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "User's goal for cleanup (e.g., 'free space', 'remove duplicates')"
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Safety-First Prompt Templates
```
You are an expert file management assistant helping users safely clean their directories.
Your primary goal is user safety - when in doubt, recommend keeping files.

For each file, provide:
1. Category (temp/working/important/system)
2. Deletion recommendation (yes/no/maybe)
3. Confidence level (high/medium/low)
4. Reasoning for your decision

Always err on the side of caution. Important files are better kept than deleted.
```

### Batch Processing Pattern
- Analyze files in batches of 50-100 to optimize API costs
- Group similar files together for better context
- Use progressive analysis with user feedback loops
- Cache results for unchanged files

## User Interaction Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
1. **Initial Scan**: Show file counts and categories only
2. **Category Selection**: User chooses which categories to examine
3. **File Details**: Show individual files within selected categories
4. **Confirmation**: Final review before deletion

### Confidence-Based Display Pattern
- **High Confidence (>90%)**: Show with green checkmark, auto-approve if user enables
- **Medium Confidence (70-90%)**: Show with yellow warning, requires manual review
- **Low Confidence (<70%)**: Show with red alert, requires explicit approval

### Natural Language Query Pattern
```
Supported query types:
- "Clean up my downloads folder"
- "Find files larger than 100MB I haven't used in 6 months"
- "Remove temporary files from system directories"
- "Show me duplicate photos"
```

## Safety Mechanism Patterns

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **File Metadata Analysis**: Never send file contents to AI
2. **Protected Directory Lists**: System directories automatically excluded
3. **Size and Type Filters**: Configurable limits for automated deletion
4. **Confirmation Gates**: Multiple approval steps before permanent deletion

### Recovery Patterns
- **Soft Delete**: Move to system trash/recycle bin first
- **Undo Window**: Keep deletion log for 30 days
- **Backup Integration**: Optional backup before major operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all AI decisions and user actions

### User Control Patterns
- **Whitelist System**: User-defined protected files and directories
- **Confidence Thresholds**: User configurable minimum confidence for auto-approval
- **Category Controls**: Enable/disable deletion by file category
- **Manual Override**: User can always override AI recommendations

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Incremental Scanning Pattern
1. **Quick Scan**: File metadata only, no API calls
2. **Smart Batching**: Group files by type and directory
3. **Progressive Loading**: Load results as they're processed
4. **Background Processing**: Run analysis while user reviews other results

### Cost Control Patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API call throttling
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API costs in real-time
- **Local Fallback**: Rule-based system when API unavailable
- **Result Caching**: Store AI decisions for repeated analysis

## Cross-Platform Patterns

### File Path Abstraction
```python
# Use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
from pathlib import Path

def get_safe_file_path(path_str):
    """Convert any path string to safe Path object"""
    return Path(path_str).resolve()
```

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- **Windows**: Handle long paths, alternate data streams
- **macOS**: Handle bundle structures, file metadata
- **Linux**: Handle symbolic links, file permissions

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
1. **API Failure**: Fall back to rule-based cleaning
2. **Network Issues**: Work with cached results when available
3. **File Access Errors**: Skip protected files and continue
4. **Memory Constraints**: Process smaller batches

### User Communication Patterns
- **Clear Error Messages**: Explain what went wrong and what to do
- **Progress Indicators**: Show real-time progress during operations
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Allow retry for temporary failures
- **Help Integration**: Context-sensitive help for all error states

## Integration Patterns

### System Integration
- **Context Menu Integration**: Right-click options in file explorers
- **Scheduled Operations**: Background cleanup at optimal times
- **Notification System**: System notifications for completion and warnings

### External Service Integration
- **Cloud Storage**: Analyze local sync folders (OneDrive, Google Drive)
- **Backup Software**: Integration with existing backup solutions
- **Development Tools**: IDE plugins for project cleanup
