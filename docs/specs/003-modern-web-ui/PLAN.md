## Specification Compliance Guidelines

### How to Ensure Specification Adherence

1. **Before Each Phase**: Complete the Pre-Implementation Specification Gate
2. **During Implementation**: Reference specific SDD sections in each task
3. **After Each Task**: Run Specification Compliance checks
4. **Phase Completion**: Verify all specification requirements are met

### Deviation Protocol

If implementation cannot follow specification exactly:
1. Document the deviation and reason
2. Get approval before proceeding
3. Update SDD if the deviation is an improvement
4. Never deviate without documentation

## Metadata Reference

  - Connection status indicators and user controls
  - Offline mode with queue-based updates

#### **User Experience Risks**

**Risk**: User Trust in AI Recommendations
- **Impact**: High - Core value proposition undermined
- **Probability**: Medium - Users fear automated file deletion
- **Mitigation**:
  - Multi-layer safety mechanisms with clear explanations
  - Progressive delegation model building trust over time
  - Transparent AI reasoning and confidence indicators
  - Comprehensive undo and recovery systems

**Risk**: Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Impact**: Medium - Legal and usability issues
- **Probability**: High - Complex interfaces often miss accessibility
- **Mitigation**:
  - Accessibility testing throughout development
  - Use accessible component library (shadcn/ui)
  - Regular accessibility audits and user testing
  - Accessibility expertise on development team

### **Risk Monitoring and Response**

#### **Early Warning Indicators**
