## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform the AI Directory Cleaner from a powerful CLI tool into an intuitive, visually stunning web-based desktop application that makes AI-powered file management accessible to all users while maintaining the advanced safety and privacy features that build user trust.

### Problem Statement
The AI Directory Cleaner currently offers sophisticated AI-powered file analysis but is limited to a command-line interface, creating a significant barrier to adoption for non-technical users. Modern users expect intuitive, visual interfaces with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time progress indicators, and clear visual feedback - expectations that CLI interfaces cannot meet. This limitation prevents the tool from reaching 95% of potential users who need AI-assisted file management but lack technical confidence or prefer visual interaction patterns. Competitors like CCleaner and BleachBit maintain market dominance through familiar graphical interfaces, despite lacking AI intelligence, because users demand visual confirmation, progressive disclosure, and intuitive workflows that build trust in automated operations.

### Value Proposition
Our modern web UI combines cutting-edge web technologies (React 18, TailwindCSS v4, shadcn/ui) with native desktop performance through Tauri, delivering a stunning cross-platform experience that makes AI-powered file management accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional desktop cleaners with rigid rule-based systems, we provide intelligent, context-aware recommendations with visual confidence indicators, transparent AI reasoning, and progressive delegation that builds trust over time. Users get the familiarity of modern web interfaces with the power and safety of our proven AI analysis backend, creating the perfect balance of automation and control that appeals to both technical and non-technical users across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Visual AI Recommendations Display (Most Complex)

**Description:** The core interface component that transforms AI analysis results into an intuitive, visual experience that builds user trust while providing comprehensive control over file deletion decisions. This feature bridges the gap between complex AI analysis and user understanding through sophisticated visual design, interactive filtering, and transparent reasoning display.

**User Flow:**
1. User selects directory for analysis through drag-and-drop or file picker interface
2. System performs AI analysis in background while showing animated progress indicators
3. Results display in a card-based grid layout with visual confidence indicators and file categorization
4. User interacts with results through filtering, sorting, and detailed inspection capabilities
5. User makes selection decisions using bulk operations or individual file reviews
6. System provides multi-step confirmation with detailed preview before execution
7. User confirms deletion and monitors real-time progress with status updates

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: All AI recommendations must display confidence scores with color-coded visual indicators (green: 0.80+, yellow: 0.60-0.79, red: <0.60)
- Rule 2: Files with confidence scores below 0.60 are automatically excluded from bulk selection operations
- Rule 3: System files, recently modified files (<30 days), and user-protected categories always show "protected" status regardless of AI recommendation
- Rule 4: Bulk selection operations require minimum 70% average confidence score across selected files
- Rule 5: AI reasoning explanations must be displayed for all files with confidence scores below 0.80
- Rule 6: Preview functionality must not open or execute files, only display metadata and location information

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: Very large file sets (>10,000 files) causing UI performance issues → Expected: System implements virtual scrolling and progressive loading with performance indicators
- Scenario 2: AI analysis fails or returns incomplete results → Expected: System displays partial results with clear error indicators and offers retry or fallback options
- Scenario 3: User selects mixed confidence files for bulk deletion → Expected: System requires additional confirmation step highlighting low-confidence items and potential risks
- Scenario 4: Files with special characters or Unicode in names → Expected: System properly displays all characters with correct encoding and provides fallback display options
- Scenario 5: Network connectivity issues during AI analysis → Expected: System caches progress, displays connection status, and resumes analysis when connectivity restored
- Scenario 6: User attempts to select protected system files → Expected: System shows protection warnings, requires explicit override confirmation, and logs all override attempts
- Scenario 7: Memory constraints during large result display → Expected: System implements pagination and efficient rendering to maintain responsive UI

**Visual Design Requirements:**
- Card layout with consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Color-coded confidence indicators with accessible contrast ratios
- Interactive elements with clear hover states and visual feedback
- Responsive design maintaining usability across different screen sizes
- Loading states and skeleton screens for smooth perceived performance
- Micro-animations for transitions, selections, and status changes

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Full keyboard navigation support with logical tab order
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- High contrast mode support with sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators visible and clearly distinguishable
- Text resizing support maintaining layout integrity
- Voice control compatibility for primary operations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Initial result display within 2 seconds for up to 1,000 files
- Smooth scrolling and filtering operations with <100ms response time
- Memory usage optimization for large file sets through virtual rendering
- Background processing to maintain UI responsiveness during AI analysis
- Progressive loading with prioritized display of high-confidence recommendations
