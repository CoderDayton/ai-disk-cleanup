## Product Overview

### Vision
Empower users to maintain clean, organized digital spaces through AI-assisted file management that combines intelligent automation with complete user control.

### Problem Statement
Digital clutter accumulates relentlessly across devices, causing storage shortages, reduced productivity, and anxiety about file management. Current cleaning tools rely on rigid rules and manual configuration, requiring significant technical expertise and risking accidental deletion of important files. Users spend valuable time managing files instead of focusing on their work, with 70% expressing fear about automated file deletion tools.

### Value Proposition
Our AI-powered directory cleaner revolutionizes file management by providing intelligent, context-aware file recommendations that learn from user behavior while maintaining absolute safety through multi-layer protection mechanisms. Unlike rule-based cleaners, our solution understands file relationships, respects user workflows, and adapts to individual preferences, delivering the perfect balance of automation and control across all major platforms.

- **Network Storage Analysis**: Local file systems only, no NAS or network share analysis
- **Real-time File Monitoring**: No background file watching, on-demand analysis only

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: AI-Powered File Analysis (Most Complex)
**Description:** The core AI functionality that analyzes file metadata and provides intelligent deletion recommendations using OpenAI's API while maintaining strict privacy and safety standards.

**User Flow:**
1. User selects directory for analysis or enters natural language query
2. System scans directory collecting file metadata (name, size, dates, paths, extensions)
3. AI analyzes files in optimized batches of 50-100 files per API call
4. System displays categorized results with confidence scores and reasoning
5. User reviews recommendations and adjusts confidence thresholds if needed
6. User selects files for deletion or approves batch recommendations
7. System moves selected files to trash/recycle bin with undo capability

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: System will NEVER send file contents to AI API, only metadata
- Rule 2: Files with confidence scores below 70% require manual review
- Rule 3: System files, user documents modified within 30 days, and files < 1KB are automatically protected
- Rule 4: API costs are tracked in real-time with user notifications at $0.50, $1.00, and $2.00 intervals
- Rule 5: When API rate limits are reached, system gracefully degrades to rule-based analysis
- Rule 6: All deletion operations use system trash/recycle bin, not permanent deletion

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: API outage or rate limit exceeded → Expected: System switches to local rule-based analysis with clear user notification
- Scenario 2: User lacks permissions for directory → Expected: System shows specific files it can access and explains access restrictions
- Scenario 3: Very large directories (>100,000 files) → Expected: System processes in incremental batches with progress indicators
- Scenario 4: Files with non-English characters in names → Expected: System properly handles Unicode and provides accurate analysis
- Scenario 5: Network connectivity issues during analysis → Expected: System caches progress and resumes when connectivity restored

### Feature: Multi-Platform Safety Mechanisms
**Description:** Platform-specific safety layers that prevent accidental deletion of critical files while providing consistent user experience.

**User Flow:**
1. System detects platform and loads appropriate safety rules
2. User initiates analysis on any directory
3. System cross-references files with platform-specific protected lists
4. Protected files are automatically excluded with explanations
5. User can override protections only with explicit confirmation
6. System maintains audit trail of all protection overrides

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Windows: Protect %SystemRoot%, Program Files, user profile folders, and registry-related files
- Rule 2: macOS: Protect /System, /Library, user home directory core files, and application bundles
- Rule 3: Linux: Protect /bin, /sbin, /etc, /usr, /boot, and user configuration directories
- Rule 4: All platforms protect files modified within last 7 days by default
- Rule 5: Files larger than 1GB require explicit confirmation regardless of AI recommendation

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: User is administrator/has elevated privileges → Expected: System maintains protection layers and requires explicit override
- Scenario 2: Symbolic links and hard links → Expected: System analyzes link targets and prevents duplicate deletion
- Scenario 3: Encrypted files and containers → Expected: System treats encrypted files as working files requiring manual review

- **Performance**: Analysis must complete within 2 minutes for typical directories (1,000 files)

### Assumptions
- **Users**: Users have basic technical comfort and are willing to configure API keys for AI benefits
- **Market**: No established AI-powered file cleaners exist, creating first-mover advantage opportunity
- **Technology**: OpenAI API will maintain reasonable pricing and availability for file metadata analysis
- **Platform**: Standard Python libraries (pathlib, send2trash) will provide sufficient cross-platform file operations
- **Adoption**: Users will prioritize AI intelligence over traditional rule-based cleaners despite API costs
