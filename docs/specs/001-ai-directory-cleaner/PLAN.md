## Specification Compliance Guidelines

### How to Ensure Specification Adherence

1. **Before Each Phase**: Complete the Pre-Implementation Specification Gate
2. **During Implementation**: Reference specific SDD sections in each task
3. **After Each Task**: Run Specification Compliance checks
4. **Phase Completion**: Verify all specification requirements are met

### Deviation Protocol

If implementation cannot follow specification exactly:
1. Document the deviation and reason
2. Get approval before proceeding
3. Update SDD if the deviation is an improvement
4. Never deviate without documentation

## Metadata Reference

- `[parallel: true]` - Tasks that can run concurrently
- `[component: component-name]` - For multi-component features
- `[ref: document/section; lines: 1, 2-3]` - Links to specifications, patterns, or interfaces and (if applicable) line(s)
- `[activity: type]` - Activity hint for specialist agent selection

## Context Priming

*GATE: You MUST fully read all files mentioned in this section before starting any implementation.*

**Specification**:

- `docs/specs/001-ai-directory-cleaner/PRD.md` - Product Requirements with user personas and feature specifications
- `docs/specs/001-ai-directory-cleaner/SDD.md` - Solution Design with technical architecture and quality requirements
- `docs/specs/001-ai-directory-cleaner/user-personas.md` - Detailed user personas and behavioral patterns
- `docs/patterns/ai-file-analysis-patterns.md` - AI integration patterns and safety mechanisms
- `docs/interfaces/openai-api-interface.md` - OpenAI API integration specifications

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **Privacy-First Design**: Only file metadata transmitted to AI, never file contents `[ref: SDD/Solution Strategy]`
- **Safety-First Architecture**: Multi-layer protection with system trash deletion only `[ref: SDD/Quality Requirements]`
- **Cross-Platform Adapter Pattern**: Unified interfaces with platform-specific implementations `[ref: SDD/Building Block View]`
- **Cost-Controlled AI**: Intelligent batching and rate limiting to manage API costs `[ref: SDD/Performance Requirements]`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Full functionality when AI unavailable using rule-based fallback `[ref: SDD/Error Handling]`

**Implementation Context**:

- **Commands to run**: `pytest tests/`, `python -m src.interfaces.cli.main`, `python -m src.interfaces.gui.main`
- **Patterns to follow**: Safety-First patterns, AI file analysis patterns, platform adapter patterns `[ref: docs/patterns/ai-file-analysis-patterns.md]`
- **Interfaces to implement**: OpenAI API integration, platform adapters, security layer `[ref: docs/interfaces/openai-api-interface.md]`
