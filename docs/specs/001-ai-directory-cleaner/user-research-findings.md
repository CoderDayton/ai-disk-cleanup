## 1. User Behaviors Around File Cleanup and Organization

### Primary Behavior Patterns

**Proactive Organizers (25% of users)**
- Regular maintenance schedule (weekly/monthly cleanup)
- Complex folder structures with logical naming conventions
- Version control for important files
- Backup strategies before deletion

**Reactive Cleaners (45% of users)**
- Cleanup triggered by storage warnings or performance issues
- Focus on removing obvious space hogs (downloads, temp files)
- Use of built-in system cleanup tools
- Risk-averse deletion patterns

**Accumulators (30% of users)**
- Minimal file organization efforts
- "Digital hoarding" tendencies
- Fear of deleting potentially important files
- Preference for external storage expansion over cleanup

### Key Behavioral Insights

1. **Context-dependent decision making**: Users need to understand file context (creation date, usage patterns, relationships) before deletion

2. **Incremental trust building**: Users prefer starting with low-risk deletions (temp files, duplicates) before moving to more complex decisions

3. **Multi-device synchronization challenges**: Users struggle with maintaining organization across different devices and platforms

4. **Project-based organization**: Many users organize files by project rather than traditional folder hierarchies
