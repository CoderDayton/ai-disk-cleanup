## Solution Strategy

### Architecture Pattern: **Layered Safety Architecture**
We're implementing a **layered safety architecture** with multiple independent protection layers, ensuring no single point of failure can compromise user data. The design prioritizes trust and safety while enabling intelligent AI-powered file management.

### Integration Approach: **Adapter Pattern for Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Using the **adapter pattern** to abstract platform-specific operations (Windows Explorer integration, macOS Finder integration, Linux file manager support) while maintaining a unified AI analysis backend across all platforms.

### Justification: **Trust-First Design**
This approach directly addresses the primary user concern - 70% fear of AI file deletion - through:
- **Multi-layer safety mechanisms** preventing accidental data loss
- **Privacy-first design** ensuring only metadata leaves the user system
- **Cross-platform consistency** maintaining user trust across devices
- **Graceful degradation** ensuring system works even when AI is unavailable

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Privacy-First AI Integration**: Only file metadata transmitted to OpenAI API, never file contents
2. **Safety-First Deletion**: All deletions use system trash/recycle bin with undo capability
3. **Platform Abstraction**: Unified interfaces with platform-specific implementations
4. **Cost-Controlled AI**: Intelligent batching and rate limiting to manage API costs
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: UI reveals complexity gradually based on user confidence

```yaml
# Application endpoints being added/modified
Endpoint: Feature Operation
  Method: HTTP_METHOD
  Path: /api/version/resource/operation
  Request:

openapi_spec: @specs/openapi.yaml
```

#### Application Data Models

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data models/entities are being created or modified? Define fields and behaviors]
```pseudocode
# Core business objects being modified/created
ENTITY: PrimaryEntity (MODIFIED/NEW)
  FIELDS: 
    existing_field: data_type

domain_doc: @docs/domain/entity-model.md
```

#### Integration Points

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What external systems does this feature connect to? For multi-component features, also document inter-component communication.]
```yaml
# Inter-Component Communication (between your components)
From: [source-component]
To: [target-component]
  - protocol: [REST/GraphQL/gRPC/WebSocket/MessageQueue]

  - integration: "Brief description of how systems connect"
  - critical_data: [data_elements_exchanged]
```

### Implementation Examples

**Purpose**: Provide strategic code examples to clarify complex logic, critical algorithms, or integration patterns. These examples are for guidance, not prescriptive implementation.

**Include examples for**:
- Complex business logic that needs clarification
- Critical algorithms or calculations
- Non-obvious integration patterns
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Performance-critical sections

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there complex areas that would benefit from code examples? If not, remove this section]

#### Example: [Complex Business Logic Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this specific example helps clarify the implementation]

```typescript
// Example: Discount calculation with multiple rules
// This demonstrates the expected logic flow, not the exact implementation
function calculateDiscount(order: Order, user: User): Discount {
  // Business rule: VIP users get additional benefits
  const baseDiscount = order.subtotal * getBaseDiscountRate(user.tier);
  
  // Complex rule: Stacking discounts with limits
  const promotionalDiscount = Math.min(
    order.promotions.reduce((sum, promo) => sum + promo.value, 0),
    order.subtotal * MAX_PROMO_PERCENTAGE
  );
  
  // Edge case: Never exceed maximum discount
  return Math.min(
    baseDiscount + promotionalDiscount,
    order.subtotal * MAX_TOTAL_DISCOUNT
  );
}
```

#### Example: [Integration Pattern Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this pattern is important to document]

```python
# Example: Retry pattern for external service integration
# Shows expected error handling approach
async def call_payment_service(transaction):
    """
    Demonstrates resilient integration pattern.
    Actual implementation may use circuit breaker library.
    """
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        try:
            response = await payment_client.process(transaction)
            if response.requires_3ds:
                # Critical: Handle 3D Secure flow
                return await handle_3ds_flow(response)
            return response
        except TransientError as e:
            if attempt == MAX_RETRIES - 1:
                # Final attempt failed, escalate
                raise PaymentServiceUnavailable(e)
            await exponential_backoff(attempt)
        except PermanentError as e:
            # Don't retry permanent failures
            raise PaymentFailed(e)
```

#### Test Examples as Interface Documentation

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can unit tests serve as interface documentation?]

```javascript
// Example: Unit test as interface contract
describe('PromoCodeValidator', () => {
  it('should validate promo code format and availability', async () => {
    // This test documents expected interface behavior
    const validator = new PromoCodeValidator(mockRepository);
    
    // Valid code passes all checks
    const validResult = await validator.validate('SUMMER2024');
    expect(validResult).toEqual({
      valid: true,
      discount: { type: 'percentage', value: 20 },
      restrictions: { minOrder: 50, maxUses: 1 }
    });
    
    // Expired code returns specific error
    const expiredResult = await validator.validate('EXPIRED2023');
    expect(expiredResult).toEqual({
      valid: false,
      error: 'PROMO_EXPIRED',
      message: 'This promotional code has expired'
    });
  });
});
```

- **File Permission Error**: Skip protected files and continue with accessible ones
- **Insufficient API Quota**: Graceful degradation with user warning and cost tracking
- **User Override**: Allow manual override of protection rules with explicit confirmation

### Complex Logic: AI Safety Assessment Algorithm

```
ALGORITHM: Multi-Layer Safety Assessment
INPUT: file_metadata, ai_recommendations, user_preferences
OUTPUT: final_safety_decision

1. GATHER: file_metadata (size, age, location, type), ai_confidence_score
2. APPLY_PROTECTION_RULES:
   - System directories (auto-protect)
   - Recent files (<30 days, require manual review)
   - Large files (>1GB, require explicit confirmation)
   - User-defined protected paths
3. CALCULATE_SAFETY_SCORE:
   - Base score = ai_confidence_score
   - Adjust for file_age_factor (older = safer)
   - Adjust for file_location_factor (temp locations = safer)
   - Adjust for user_behavior_factor (user patterns)
4. DETERMINE_ACTION:
   - IF safety_score >= 0.95: Recommend deletion
   - IF safety_score >= 0.70: Recommend review
   - IF safety_score < 0.70: Recommend keeping
5. AUDIT: Log all decisions with reasoning and data trail
```
