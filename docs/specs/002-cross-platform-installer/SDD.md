## Solution Strategy

- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular Build Orchestrator with Platform-Specific Adapters. A central build orchestrator manages the installation process while delegating platform-specific packaging to specialized builders that leverage native tools.

- **Integration Approach**: Leverages existing platform adapter pattern from the core application to maintain consistency. The installer system extends this pattern to the build and packaging domain, ensuring seamless integration with current architecture.

- **Justification**: This approach balances maintainability (single codebase) with platform-specific requirements (native installer experience). It aligns with existing architectural patterns while providing the flexibility needed for cross-platform distribution.

- **Key Decisions**:
  1. **PyInstaller + Native Packers**: PyInstaller handles core Python packaging while native tools (WiX, dmgbuild, AppImageKit) create platform-specific installers
  2. **Unified Configuration**: Single source of truth for build parameters across all platforms
  3. **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive code signing and integrity verification built into the build process
  4. **Progressive Disclosure UI**: Supports both simple one-click installation and advanced configuration modes

## Runtime View

### Primary Flow

#### Primary Flow: Cross-Platform Installer Build Process
1. User invokes build command (e.g., `python -m installer build all`)
2. Build Orchestrator validates environment and dependencies
3. Configuration Manager loads unified build configuration
4. PyInstaller creates platform-agnostic binary bundle
5. Platform-specific builders generate native packages
6. Security Manager applies code signing and integrity verification
7. Final installers are validated and packaged for distribution

```

### Error Handling

- **Build Environment Issues**: Clear error messages with setup instructions and links to documentation
- **Certificate Problems**: Automated certificate renewal alerts and manual signing fallback procedures
- **Platform-Specific Failures**: Isolated build failures don't stop other platform builds, with detailed error logs
- **Security Validation Failures**: Build halted immediately with comprehensive security audit report

### Complex Logic

#### Multi-Platform Build Coordination
```
ALGORITHM: Coordinated Multi-Platform Build
INPUT: build_config, target_platforms
OUTPUT: signed_installers

1. PARALLELIZE: Platform builds based on available build agents
2. ORCHESTRATE: Dependency resolution across platforms
3. VALIDATE: Intermediate build artifacts at each stage
4. AGGREGATE: Build status across all platforms
5. COORDINATE: Code signing with certificate availability
6. VERIFY: Package integrity and security compliance
7. PACKAGE: Final distribution artifacts with metadata
8. REPORT: Comprehensive build summary and metrics
## Deployment View

### Single Application Deployment
- **Environment**: Cross-platform build system using GitHub Actions with platform-specific runners
- **Configuration**: Unified YAML configuration files with platform-specific overrides
- **Dependencies**: PyInstaller, WiX Toolset (Windows), dmgbuild/pkgbuild (macOS), AppImageKit/dpkg/rpmbuild (Linux)
- **Performance**: Build time target of 25-40 minutes total across all platforms with parallel execution

### Architecture Decisions

- [ ] **PyInstaller + Native Packers**: Using PyInstaller as core bundling engine augmented with platform-specific packaging tools
  - Rationale: Leverages familiar Python ecosystem while providing native installation experiences
  - Trade-offs: Additional complexity in build pipeline vs superior user experience
  - User confirmed: _Pending_

- [ ] **Security-First Build Process**: Comprehensive code signing and integrity verification built into the build pipeline
  - Rationale: Meets enterprise security requirements and builds user trust
  - Trade-offs: Increased build complexity and certificate management overhead
  - User confirmed: _Pending_

- [ ] **Modular Build Orchestrator**: Central coordination with platform-specific builders
  - Rationale: Enables parallel builds and independent platform optimization
  - Trade-offs: More complex architecture vs better maintainability and scalability
  - User confirmed: _Pending_

## Quality Requirements

- **Performance**: Build time under 60 minutes total, installer size under 100MB, installation time under 3 minutes
- **Usability**: One-click installation for non-technical users, advanced options for power users, native platform experience
- **Security**: Code signing on all platforms, integrity verification, no bundled software, transparent security communication
- **Reliability**: 95%+ installation success rate, automated error recovery, comprehensive testing coverage

## Risks and Technical Debt

### Known Technical Issues
- **PyInstaller Compatibility**: Some Python packages may not freeze correctly and require custom hooks
- **Platform-Specific Bugs**: Native packaging tools have platform-specific quirks and limitations
- **Certificate Management**: Code signing certificates have complex lifecycle management requirements

### Technical Debt
- **Build Script Complexity**: Multiple platform builds increase maintenance overhead
- **Test Matrix**: Comprehensive testing across three platforms multiplies testing effort
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation required for build processes and security procedures

### Implementation Gotchas
- **Build Environment Isolation**: Cross-platform builds require completely isolated build environments
- **Dependency Pinning**: Reproducible builds require exact dependency version pinning across platforms
- **Security Timing**: Code signing must happen after package generation but before final validation

## Test Specifications

### Critical Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Successful Multi-Platform Build**
```gherkin
Given: Clean build environment with all dependencies installed
And: Valid code signing certificates available
When: User runs "python -m installer build all"
Then: All platform installers built successfully
And: All installers properly signed and verified
And: Build completes within 60 minutes
```

**Scenario 2: Code Signing Failure Recovery**
```gherkin
Given: Build environment ready for signing
When: Code signing certificate is invalid or expired
Then: Build process halts with clear error message
And: Manual signing instructions provided
And: Build can be resumed after certificate issue resolved
```

**Scenario 3: Platform-Specific Build Failure**
```gherkin
Given: Multi-platform build in progress
When: Windows build fails due to environment issues
Then: Other platform builds continue uninterrupted
And: Detailed Windows error log generated
And: Build can be retried for failed platform only
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Build Logic**: All orchestrator and builder code paths, error handling, configuration validation
- **Platform Integration**: Native packaging tool integration, certificate management, security verification
- **Cross-Platform**: Installer behavior on each target platform, UI consistency, platform-specific features
- **Security**: Code signing workflows, integrity verification, malware scanning, certificate validation
- **Performance**: Build time limits, package size constraints, installation speed requirements
