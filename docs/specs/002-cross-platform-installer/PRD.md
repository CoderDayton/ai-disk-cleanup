## Product Overview

### Vision
To create the industry's first truly unified cross-platform installer experience that builds instant trust through transparency, simplicity, and platform-native integration for AI-powered disk cleanup.

### Problem Statement
Users face a fragmented installer landscape where cross-platform tools provide inconsistent experiences across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Current installers suffer from security concerns (bundled software, unclear permissions), complexity (overwhelming configuration options), and trust issues (poor design, lack of transparency). This creates friction during the critical first interaction with software, leading to abandoned installations and reduced user adoption.

### Value Proposition
Our installer delivers a unified, trustworthy experience that eliminates security concerns through transparent installation processes, provides platform-native interfaces that feel familiar to users, and offers progressive disclosure that serves both technical and non-technical users. Unlike competitors who focus on single platforms or bundle unwanted software, we provide a clean, secure installation that builds immediate confidence in the AI Disk Cleanup tool.

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Cross-Platform Installer Engine
**Description:** The core installer engine that generates platform-specific installers from a single Python codebase using PyInstaller or similar packaging tools. This feature handles platform detection, dependency management, and native package generation while maintaining consistent user experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**User Flow:**
1. User downloads installer appropriate for their platform from website
2. System runs platform-specific installer (MSI/DMG/AppImage)
3. Installer performs system compatibility check
4. User selects installation type (Simple vs Advanced)
5. Installer displays security verification and installation summary
6. Installation progresses with clear feedback and time estimates
7. Installation completes with confirmation and next steps

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: When installer detects unsupported system version, display clear upgrade requirements and prevent installation
- Rule 2: When digital signature verification fails, display security warning and prevent installation
- Rule 3: When insufficient disk space detected, show space requirements and allow user to free space or choose different location
- Rule 4: When installation completes successfully, offer to launch application and show getting started guide
- Rule 5: When installation fails, provide specific error messages and recovery options

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: User cancels installation mid-process → Expected: Rollback partial changes, restore system to pre-installation state
- Scenario 2: Installation interrupted by system reboot → Expected: Resume installation after reboot or provide clean reinstallation option
- Scenario 3: Antivirus software blocks installer → Expected: Provide whitelist instructions and alternative installation methods
- Scenario 4: Network connection lost during download → Expected: Resume download capability or restart from where it left off
- Scenario 5: User attempts to install over existing version → Expected: Offer upgrade, repair, or reinstall options

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Adoption:** 80% of website visitors who reach download page complete installation successfully within 7 days
- **Engagement:** 95% of users who complete installation run the application at least once within 24 hours
- **Quality:** 95%+ installation success rate on first attempt, average installation time under 3 minutes
- **Business Impact:** 40% reduction in support tickets related to installation issues compared to manual setup

### Tracking Requirements

| Event | Properties | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Installer Download | Platform, version, source | Measure download effectiveness and platform distribution |
| Installation Start | System specs, installation type | Understand user requirements and compatibility issues |
| Installation Complete | Duration, errors, components installed | Measure installer performance and success rates |
| Installation Failed | Error type, system specs, failure point | Identify and fix common installation problems |
| Application Launch | Time from installation, user type | Measure user engagement and first-run experience |
| Uninstallation | Reason, usage duration, components used | Understand product retention and improvement opportunities |

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Build Environment:** Separate build machines required for each target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Code Signing:** Digital certificates required for each platform ($299/year Apple Developer, $70/year EV Code Signing)
- **Package Size:** Installers must be under 100MB to accommodate users with limited bandwidth
- **Python Dependencies:** All Python packages must be compatible with PyInstaller freezing

### Assumptions
- **User Technical Level:** Average user has basic computer skills but limited technical installation knowledge
- **System Access:** Users have administrative privileges on their machines for software installation
- **Network Connectivity:** Users have reliable internet access for downloading installers and updates
- **Security Standards:** Users expect enterprise-grade security and transparency from utility software

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Platform-specific compatibility issues | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing matrix, gradual rollout with telemetry |
| Security certificate management complexity | High | Low | Automated certificate renewal, backup signing certificates |
| PyInstaller dependency conflicts | Medium | High | Dependency isolation, regular testing with PyInstaller updates |
| Platform store approval delays (App Store, Microsoft Store) | Medium | Medium | Focus on direct distribution first, store submission as secondary channel |
| User security concerns during installation | High | High | Transparent installation process, third-party security verification, clear privacy policy |

## Open Questions

- [ ] What should be the minimum system requirements for each platform?
- [ ] Should we offer automatic updates or manual update checking?
- [ ] Do we need to support ARM architecture (Apple Silicon, Windows ARM)?
- [ ] What level of customization should be available in advanced installation mode?
- [ ] Should we provide portable/standalone versions alongside installers?
