## Product Overview

### Vision
To create a comprehensive testing and deployment automation framework that enables reliable, repeatable, and efficient delivery of the AI Disk Cleaner desktop application across all supported platforms.

### Problem Statement
The AI Disk Cleaner project currently lacks automated testing scripts and production deployment infrastructure, making releases manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Developers must manually coordinate complex cross-platform builds, testing procedures, and deployment processes, which slows development velocity and increases the risk of production issues.

### Value Proposition

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Automated Testing Framework
**Description:** Comprehensive testing infrastructure covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with automated execution and reporting.

**User Flow:**
1. Developer writes code and commits changes
2. CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers test suite execution
3. Tests run in parallel across multiple environments
4. Results are aggregated and reported to team
5. Failed tests block deployment until resolved

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: All pull requests must pass 100% of automated tests before merging
- Rule 2: Code coverage must remain above 80% for all new changes
- Rule 3: Critical user workflows must have E2E test coverage
- Rule 4: Security tests must pass for all dependency updates
- Rule 5: Performance tests must not regress more than 10% from baseline

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: Tests fail due to external API dependencies → Expected: Mock external services and continue testing
- Scenario 2: Cross-platform tests have inconsistent results → Expected: Flag for manual review and platform-specific investigation
- Scenario 3: Test execution timeout → Expected: Fail gracefully with detailed error logs and system state capture

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Adoption:** 100% of developers using automated testing within 2 weeks of implementation
- **Engagement:** Average of 50 test executions per day across the team
- **Quality:** 95% reduction in production bugs detected by users within 3 months
- **Business Impact:** 80% reduction in time spent on manual testing and deployment preparation

### Tracking Requirements

| Cross-platform build failures delay releases | High | Medium | Implement parallel builds, early platform testing, maintain build matrix |
| Code signing certificate management becomes bottleneck | High | Low | Automate certificate storage and rotation, use secure secret management |
| Test flakiness reduces team confidence in automation | Medium | Medium | Implement test retry logic, identify and isolate flaky tests, maintain test hygiene |
| Team resistance to new automated workflows | Medium | Low | Provide comprehensive training, demonstrate value quickly, gather feedback continuously |

## Open Questions

- [ ] What is the budget for code signing certificates across all platforms?
- [ ] Should we invest in self-hosted runners for faster builds or use GitHub-hosted exclusively?
- [ ] What are the specific compliance requirements for the AI features in different markets?
- [ ] Should we implement canary releases or stick with standard deployment model?
